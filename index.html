        <h4>New School Canteen</h4>
        <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A cafeteria, sometimes called a canteen outside the U.S., is a type of food service location in which there is little or no waiting staff table service, whether a restaurant or within an institution such as a large office building or school; a school dining location is also referred to as a dining hall or lunchroom (in American English).[1] Cafeterias are different from coffeehouses, although the English term came from the Spanish cafeter√≠a, same meaning. Instead of table service, there are food-serving counters/stalls or booths, either in a line or allowing arbitrary walking paths. Customers take the food that they desire as they walk along, placing it on a tray. In addition, there are often stations where customers order food, particularly items such as hamburgers or tacos which must be served hot and can be immediately prepared with little waiting. Alternatively, the patron is given a number and the item is brought to their table. For some food items and drinks, such as sodas, water, or the like, customers collect an empty container, pay at the check-out, and fill the container after the check-out. Free unlimited second servings are often allowed under this system. For legal purposes (and the consumption patterns of customers), this system is rarely, if at all, used for alcoholic drinks in the United States.</p>

      <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.Accurancy
        Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supportingcomputational devices. Automated attendance
        systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry.
        this accurate data threrby helps to provide accurate performance and pay roll data. 
        <br>
        <br>
        2.Economics
        Have you ever thought that attendance management systemcould control costs? It saves money by putting an end
        to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness. time abuse and over payment. As a matter
        of fact, a study done by the Axsium group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after
        implementing automated attendance managememt system.
        <br>
        <br>
        3.Productivity / Efficiency
        Monitering and managing attendance manualy can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes
        time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules,autherise leave and overtime and create
        payroll manualy. Free up precious administeration time up with an automated system that does it all for you, from
        keeping track of employee hoyrs to automatically importing infarmaion into your payroll system. the time and
        effort saved combined with daa accurancy helps in optimizing the use of resoures which lead to increased
        productivity and improves profits. And many more like visibility / Insights, Massel Free Workflow Management,
